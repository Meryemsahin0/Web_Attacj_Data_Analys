This dataset comprises web traffic records gathered via AWS CloudWatch with the purpose of identifying suspicious activities and potential attack endeavors. 
It was generated by monitoring traffic to a live web server, utilizing diverse detection rules to pinpoint abnormal patterns.

In the contemporary landscape of cloud computing, cybersecurity holds immense importance. Detecting and responding to threats promptly can shield organizations from severe repercussions.
This dataset furnishes insights into labeled suspicious web traffic, serving as a valuable asset for developers, data scientists, and security professionals aiming to bolster their threat detection methodologies.


The project covers my first data science codes, so I made up for my inexperience with artificial intelligence.
